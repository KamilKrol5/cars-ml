# Cars with Machine Learning
Team project for Python Course on VI semester. The only constraint in this project is to use Python.
The target of our project is to create an application to train cars driving through a route without any accident using genetic algorithms and neural networks.

Working on this project was fun and brought couple of interesting problems. It was also a great opportunity to learn/practise using Python3. When the grading time at the university has come, we got the highest possible grade for this project: 5.5.

We used our own neural network (multilayer-perceptron) implementation.
As we used genetic algorithm, we had to create some environment in which cars (neural networks to be more precise) could be tested.
This testing, as a part of the whole training process, had to be presented in the UI. We used simple UI framework - PyGame.
In order to handle some PyGame framework limitations, we implemented the environment simulation as a coroutine. 
The project is definetly not 100% finished and we plan to finish it and refactor some parts of code someday (but it'll probably never happen).
