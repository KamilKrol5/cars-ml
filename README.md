# Cars with Machine Learning
Team project for Python Course on university on VI semester. 
The target of our project is to create an application to train cars driving through a route without any accident using genetic algorithms and neural networks and learning/practising Python.

As we used genetic algorithm, we had to create an environment in which cars (neural networks to be more precise) could be tested.
This testing, as a part of the whole training process, had to be presented in the UI. We used a simple UI framework - PyGame.
In order to handle some PyGame framework limitations, we implemented the environment simulation as a coroutine. 
The project is definetly not 100% finished and we plan to finish it and refactor some parts of code someday (but it'll probably never happen).
